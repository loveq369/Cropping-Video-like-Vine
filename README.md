Cropping-Video-like-Vine
========================

Cropping Video Square like vine and instagram.
While working on a project I found the benefits of having a square video resolution (e.g. 600 x 600) very useful for things such as file size, upload speed and buffering. This is probably why video apps such as vine and instgram use similar resolutions. However for something seemly simple I could not find very much on the web at all for producing such effects in objective C, Xcode.. Apparently IOS 7 has a new function to crop video but I didnâ€™t look into it as many people still use IOS 6.  Anyway so I thought I might kick start my tutorial section with a short tutorial on cropping video to a square with the project file being available for download at the end.
